CHARISMAX
CHARISMAX
Are you ready?
Everybody make some noise
Nobody can copy the formula
Star-led Guidance CHARISMA
Trending, we're makin' it (Ugh) Always we're
tactical, yeah, CHARISMA
Haters, I gotta tell ya, don't give a damn
Do what you love CHARISMA
All day long, let it Ring a Ring a ling
Win? Lose? That's not the "Problem"
"A minor mistake"
The mindset, that's the "Problem"
Alright, I'm gonna define
Everyone push ahead with strong heart, shout it
out to world
We are! We are! No.1
CHARISMAX
The one and only mind CHARISMAX
Now rewrite the age CHARISMAX
We gon gasp the world
Better watch us, everyone is Crazy crazy man
Much beyond the common sense, we are CHARISMAX
Don't you see life's like a stage we stand on
Doing a role-play CHARISMA
You can do anything, right, I know that you can
be anything CHARISMA
Wannabes, I gotta tell ya, don't give a damn
Do what you want CHARISMA
Sing along, let's get it, Ding a ding a ling
Let me change it all, it's my style
Sticking out genius
No fake smiles, make it right
Alright, answer's generous
Everyone push ahead with strong heart, shout it
out to world
We are! We are! No.1
CHARISMAX
The talent's not an imitation CHARISMAX
Unstoppable evolution CHARISMAX
Go beyond the limitation
Better watch us, everyone is Crazy crazy woman
Everyone push ahead with strong heart, shout it
out to world
We are! We are! No.1
CHARISMAX
The one and only mind CHARISMAX
Now rewrite the age CHARISMAX
We gon gasp the world
Better watch us, everyone is Crazy crazy man
CHARISMAX
The talent's not an imitation CHARISMAX
Unstoppable evolution CHARISMAX
Go beyond the limitation
Better watch us, everyone is Crazy crazy woman
Much beyond the common sense, we are CHARISMAX
